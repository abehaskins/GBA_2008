========

A bunch of little demos for GBA from 2008

History
-------
In 2008 I had been writing a lot of Flash games and recently started developing on Linux. I wanted to make games and so I picked the most round-about way of doing this by developing for an already old console, known as the Gameboy Advance. The only "complete" game is Blix, which was written in 2 weeks over my Winter break during my first year in college. The rest are just little demos which bring some memories back.
